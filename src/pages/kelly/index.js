                <p>Reverend James Kelly was called to serve at two churches in western Pennsylvania. He was first called to Christ Lutheran Church in 1920 in Erie, PA. He served for a time there before moving just outside of Pittsburgh to Munhall, PA where he served at Messiah Lutheran Church. On November 30th, 1920, just after his first call to a parish, Rev. Kelly married Hope Anna (Eyster) Kelly. The service was held in the Lutheran Memorial Church in Washington, D.C. While serving his congregation in Erie, James and Hope welcomed into the world their daughter, Gladys Kelly on July 21st, 1922.</p>

                <p>In 1926 Pastor Kelly accepted a call at Holy Trinity Lutheran Church in Wilmington, DE where he would spend the majority of his career. When Pastor Kelly began his ministry at Holy Trinity, the congregation had 153 members. Pastor Kelly was determined to bring God’s word to his new congregation and change a few lives along the way.</p>
                <p>Throughout his time in Wilmington, Pastor Kelly helped start many new projects. He became extremely active within the community and served in God’s name in every role he played. He began his endeavors by helping to organize the Wilmington Ministerial Association, a collection of churches from around the area that would volunteer within the community. Pastor Kelly became the Association’s first president and set it on a course that would allow it to continue for years. </p>

                <p>In an effort to become more active within his community, Pastor Kelly became a member of the Wilmington Council of Churches. In 1951, while representing the Council, Pastor Kelly was given the opportunity to appear on television to deliver a sermon entitled “Instrument’s in God’s Hands.” He brought along with him members of a choir to sing a few hymns after he spoke. In 1946, he became a delegate to the synod of United Lutheran Church. He acted as their chairman in 1949 and completed his time with them in 1950.</p>

                <p>Due his commitment to his church and surrounding community, it is unsurprising that he “didn’t have time for any real hobbies.” However, he was a lifetime member of the Lions Club.</p>
                <p>In 1953, Pastor Kelly left Holy Trinity to answer the call to St. George Lutheran Church, a struggling parish in Edinburg, Indiana.

                <p>Pastor Kelly served his Edinburg congregation until 1958 when he and his wife retired to Connersville, Indiana.

In 1969, Rev. Kelly he was designated Pastor Emeritus of his Connersville congregation and his two other congregations in Munhall and Edinburg due to his dedication to the church and community.</p>

                <p>Pastor James F. Kelly entered God’s Kingdom on February 8, 1983, just 10 years after his wife’s passing. His dedication to the church, his family, and his community was apparent in everything he did and everyone he served. Rev. Kelly felt the call to God, his country, and his community many times throughout his life. He was determined to help others and make a change in the world in everything he did.</p>
                <p>Due to his dedication to the church and his community, it was decided that the $30 million would be given to the seminary in his memory. This gift will be given exclusively for student scholarships and an endowed chair. This bequest will continue the mission Rev. Kelly pursued his entire life: to spread God’s word and do what is necessary to cultivate a loving community.</p>
